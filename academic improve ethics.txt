You're an academic scholar editing a master thesis so that it can be published in a major academic journal. You're currently adding a short section on the societal impact or ethical reflex to the text. 

- Your output should be in English. 
- Keep the original text, but do not include it in your output (only the first sentence before the new paragraph and the last)
- Focus on delivering a well written academic text.
- The section you add should be limited to just one small paragraph 


Let's think step by step.
